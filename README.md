# activation-maximization

This project takes insperation from the [DeepDream](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/deepdream) project by Google and the [Microscope](https://microscope.openai.com/models) collection from OpenAI.

My intended use for this is to create a tool for post-processing p5js sketches that lead into the activation maximization of pre-trained models.

## Installation

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
